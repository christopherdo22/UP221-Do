# UP221-Do
## Who am I?
Hi everyone! I'm Chris and I'm a MURP (Masters of Urban and Regional Planning) student at UCLA concentrating on Community Economic Development and Housing. Originally from the DC metro area (NoVa), I came to LA in the fall of 2021 for school. Before UCLA, I worked at a DC-based housing nonprofit where I worked on a housing voucher program for low-income households living with HIV/AIDS. Before that, I worked at an immigration law firm. My interests in planning are centered around planning for immigrant communities. I'm open to pursuing any projects across a variety of topic areas, including affordable housing, green space, job access, and food access.
## What is UP221?
This course is Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science.
## Class Objectives
I'm hoping to learn how to code effectively and use GIS/geospatial data at a professional level. I'm fascinated by GIS and how I can become a better planner through GIS.
## Project Ideas
# 1. DC TOPA and Buyout Data
After living in DC and working at a housing non-profit, one of the battlegrounds between developers and housing activists is TOPA, which stands for Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act. Tenants have the right to first purchase buildings that are being sold, and developers try to buy out these rights from tenants, with sums ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 per household. It would be interesting to map where new buildings are being purchased, and tracing who is purchasing these buildings (tenants and co-ops or developers).
# 2. DC Homeownership, Corporate Homeownership, and Ties to Great Recession
I would also be interested in applying the ideas to DC from a study I read about in the South that traced foreclosure from 2008 and the prevelance of corporate homeownership rates in neighborhoods. It would look at overall DC homeownership rates, foreclosure rates from the 2008 crisis, and then map corporate homeowners (measured through LLC transactions).
